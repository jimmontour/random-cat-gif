**Random Cat Gif Generator**
---
This was a small project from The Odin Project to learn how to use the Fetch API to incorporate the Giphy API onto a browser page.

Each time the page loads, a random cat .gif appears.

Includes functionality to generate new images or change the search terms for the random image.
